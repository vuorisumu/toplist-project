## Why Listmaker?

Listmaker allows you to make templates and top lists easily and compare the results with other users. It also stores the date and time of top list creation, allowing you to use the same template again and compare how your own opinions have changed over time.

Top list creation mode also allows you to add a description, as well as item-specific notes, if you feel the need to explain your choices. It also allows you to add new items that weren't present in the original template, so you don't need to make a completely new one if the original creator of the template forgot to put something in there.

## How to use Listmaker 9000?

Go to [Listmaker 9000 website](https://toplistmaker.onrender.com/), find a template you like and start ranking! Or create an account and start making your own templates!
